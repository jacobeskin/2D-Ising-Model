2D Ising Model.

compilation: make -f makeising
running: ./IsingEx.exe

Studying the 2D Ising model with periodic boundary conditions and
where only the four  nearest neighbours have an effect with different
external magnetic fields and temperatures. 

Visualizations of simulations are in .avi files. Spin up is blue, down is red.
Visualizations are as follows:

-zero H with low T are zeroHlowTferromagnet.avi for the ferromagnetic and 
 lowTzeroHantiferromagnet.ave 
-low T and low H are lowTlowHferromagnet.avi
-high T and low H are highTlowHferromagnet.avi
